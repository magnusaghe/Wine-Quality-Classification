# Abstract
This project uses the Random Forest model to classify wine quality as either Excellent, Good or Poor. The model has an 84% accuracy.
Developed by Magnus Aghe as part of the Machine Learning Deployment course ANA680 at National University, San Diego, CA.
The model uses four predictors namely Alcohol, Volatile Acidity, Sulphates, and Citric Acid. 
Dataset used is Wine Quality Dataset obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality
